As an SEO who has worked for agencies and startups over the past decade, I've seen the transition from keyword-focused to entity-driven SEO. As I scroll through my timelines and read blog posts, I see that most SEOs either are unaware of semantic and entity SEO or misunderstand the core elements.

More than a decade ago, [Google introduced the Knowledge Graph](https://blog.google/products/search/introducing-knowledge-graph-things-not/) to help users find the right information and make new connections to the things, topics, or people they were searching for. This announcement was made over a decade ago and is, I believe, more relevant than ever in the search landscape right now.

Things, not strings. That's what Google said in that post, and it was a way to let us know that Google understands _things_ &mdash; not just keywords. This is the basis for semantic and entity SEO strategies.

In this post, I aim to demystify some fundamental aspects of semantic search, such as entities, topics, and keywords, and explain how they can impact your SEO strategy, improving relevance and visibility.

## Exploring entities, topics, and keywords

Entities, topics, and keywords are deeply connected when it comes to search, and a better understanding of each will help you refine your SEO strategy.

### Entities

Let's answer your first question: what are entities? In SEO, an entity is anything that is unique and identifiable, like a person, organization, location, thing, idea or concept. An entity could be "apple" like the fruit but it could also be "Apple" like the company. In regards to concepts, an entity could also be "Coachella" or "La Tomatina".

Entities are not tied to specific keywords, they represent broader ideas. Search engines like Google use entities to better understand the meaning and context behind a user's search query.

If a user searches with a keyword phrase like "Coachella tickets", "Coachella" is the entity.

### Keywords

In SEO, keywords are the specific terms that users type into their search engine. You may have also heard of them referred to as search queries. They are how a user tries to find information and what search engines (and SEO alike) use to determine the intent of the user search to deliver the right content.
