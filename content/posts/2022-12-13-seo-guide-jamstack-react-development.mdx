In my experience as a professional SEO, working with development teams can be challenging. Sometimes they don't understand the value of SEO, making it harder to get technical recommendations prioritized in a sprint. Other times, SEOs provide unclear implementation instructions, making it difficult for dev teams to do what is needed.

The reason for releasing this guide is to give some context and instruction to developers as to why SEO agencies and teams need their help. I want developers, Jamstack or otherwise, to understand how important SEO is for their clients or marketing teams. My goal is to provide some insight and best practices that devs can use when building marketing, blog, or e-commerce websites.

## Intro to SEO for Developers

Whether in your professional life or otherwise, you may have heard of SEO. Regardless of what you may have heard, I want you to know that SEO in 2023 is more than title tags and meta descriptions. Those tags are still important, but there are many other factors that search engines use to rank web pages.

Beyond those hundreds of ranking factors, SEOs deal with fierce competition in search result listings. When you implement a JSON-LD snippet for that "schema thing" you keep hearing about, you're helping to take advantage of Google's many search result features.

I won't bore you with all the (glorious) details, but SEO can help your client or company achieve their goals. With that in mind, let's get to the good stuff.

## What is SEO?

SEO, or search engine optimization, is the strategy to get your web content to rank better on Google (and other search engines). Higher search engine rankings lead to more organic traffic, which can result in subscribers or customers.

SEO is more complex than it has ever been. Beyond keywords and page titles, SEOs must also consider branding, user experience, search intent, and user behavior.

SEO is an ongoing process that is continually tweaked to get results. What ranks #1 today may not rank tomorrow. With a foundational understanding of SEO, you can provide more value for your clients or marketing teams.

### What is Technical SEO?

As a developer, SEOs usually need your help to implement technical fixes. Technical SEO includes methods to optimize website crawlability, indexing, and performance. You might need to create or update XML sitemaps and robots.txt files, implement redirects, or improve web performance.

There's actually quite a number of things that you might be asked to help implement. Let's explore some of them below.

#### Crawlability & indexing
