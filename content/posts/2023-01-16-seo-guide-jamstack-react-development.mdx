In my experience as a professional SEO, working with development teams can be challenging. Sometimes they don't understand the value of SEO, making it harder to get technical recommendations prioritized in a sprint. Other times, SEOs provide unclear implementation instructions, making it difficult for dev teams to do what is needed.

The reason for releasing this guide is to give some context and instruction to developers as to why SEO agencies and teams need their help. I want developers, Jamstack or otherwise, to understand how important SEO is for their clients or marketing teams. My goal is to provide some insight and best practices that devs can use when building marketing, blog, or e-commerce websites.

## Intro to SEO for Developers

Whether in your professional life or otherwise, you may have heard of SEO. Regardless of what you may have heard, I want you to know that SEO in 2023 is more than title tags and meta descriptions. Those tags are still important, but there are many other factors that search engines use to rank web pages.

Beyond those hundreds of ranking factors, SEOs deal with fierce competition in search result listings. When you implement a JSON-LD snippet for that "schema thing" you keep hearing about, you're helping to take advantage of Google's many search result features.

I won't bore you with all the (glorious) details, but SEO can help your client or company achieve their goals. With that in mind, let's get to the good stuff.

## What is SEO?

SEO, or search engine optimization, is the strategy to get your web content to rank better on Google (and other search engines). Higher search engine rankings lead to more organic traffic, which can result in subscribers or customers.

SEO is more complex than it has ever been. Beyond keywords and page titles, SEOs must also consider branding, user experience, search intent, and user behavior.

SEO is an ongoing process that is continually tweaked to get results. What ranks #1 today may not rank tomorrow. With a foundational understanding of SEO, you can provide more value for your clients or marketing teams.

### Defining Technical SEO

As a developer, SEOs usually need your help to implement technical fixes. Technical SEO includes methods to optimize website crawlability, indexing, and performance. You might need to create or update XML sitemaps and robots.txt files, implement redirects, or improve web performance.

There's actually quite a number of things that you might be asked to help implement. Let's explore some of them below.

## Crawling & Indexing

If you want to appear on a search engine results page (SERP), web crawlers must be able to navigate your website. Google is the largest search engine, but others like Bing, Baidu, DuckDuckGo, and Yandex exist.

If you are targeting customers or clients in [China](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/all/china) or [Russia](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/all/russian-federation), you'll want to check out the guidelines for the top-used search engines in each country.

### Web Crawlers and How They Work

Web crawlers, also called spiders, are bots that navigate websites through links found on websites. You can identify if a user on your site is a web crawler via their User-Agent. The two main web crawlers Google uses are Googlebot Desktop and Googlebot Smartphone.

Google processes JavaScript web apps in 5 main stages:

1. **Discover URLs** &mdash; Google discovers URLs from several sources, including XML sitemaps, Google Search Console, and links from other websites.
2. **Add URLs to Crawl Queue** &mdash; Google adds discovered URLs to the Crawl Queue to be processed. It usually takes just moments to move a URL through the Crawl Queue, but it may take up to days.
3. **Process URLs** &mdash; Googlebot grabs a URL from the Crawl Queue by making an HTTP request. If you don't allow crawling on your site (more on that later), then Googlebot will skip making the HTTP request.
4. **Render HTML** &mdash; Googlebot will then parse the HTML response. If you build your website with technologies like React, those URLs will be moved to a Render Queue so that Google can execute JavaScript to parse the rendered HTML.
5. **Index URLs** &mdash; If your webpages meet all of Google's benchmarks, they will be eligible to be indexed and shown on search engine result listings.

### HTTP Status Codes

When Googlebot makes the HTTP request described in stage 3 above, the server hosting the website will send a response in the form of an HTTP status code. While there are several status codes, only a handful are meaningful for basic SEO. Let's explore [some of these status codes](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/http-network-errors#http-status-codes) and how they affect Google search.

- **2xx** mdash; Google will pass on the content for indexing if it returns a `200 OK` or `201 Created` status. This does _not_ guarantee indexing, but it does mean the page is eligible to show in search results.
- **3xx** &mdash; There are a couple 300 status codes SEOs use for redirecting URLs.
